## General Background Links 

### The Four V's of Big Data
This is a [classic IBM infographic](https://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/infographic/four-vs-big-data) describing a traditional definition of what makes Big Data "big".

### Big Data Landscape

This [blog post by Matt Turck](https://mattturck.com/data2019/) and [associated infographic](http://mattturck.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019_Matt_Turck_Big_Data_Landscape_Final_Fullsize.png) have tracked the exploding numbers of players in the business of big data.

### Venn Diagram of Data Science

Another classic infographic defining data science, originally developed by Conway, and elaborated on this [KDnuggets blog post](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/02/essential-data-science-venn-diagram.html), along with a [compilation of past efforts](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/10/battle-data-science-venn-diagrams.html).

### Big Data and Privacy

Privacy is one lens through which to understand both the ethical challenges and the enormous scope of big data in our lives and society.  The [New York Times Privacy Project](https://www.nytimes.com/series/new-york-times-privacy-project) is one good place to review recent developments, especially the article on [cell phone location data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html).

## For the February 10 class

### Workshop links

See the [graduate specialist workshops](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/graduatespecialist/workshops) for upcoming Python, R, Text mining, GIS, and qualitative data workshops on campus.

The [R libguide](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/data_R) has additional information about learning R, including links to videos.

### Data visualization - ggplot2 and Shiny

We will use the scripts and demos from the [ryandata Github page](https://github.com/ryandata/tidyverse_approach) to illustrate these techniques.
